JAILBREAK TRADEBOT 2.0

What does this do? What is this project about? Read this message and you'll be properly informed.

This jailbreak tradebot is a project in which people can go to jailbreak's trading lobbies, and trade their items automatically for overpays.
Leading to profits only! You may be wondering, how does this work? Here we go;

The tradebot automatically scans users, past trades you made, and inventories in the lobby you sit in.
It'll look for messages similar as "Looking for Brulee", why? Because people that are looking for specific items, are more willing to give overpays for the item.
What does the bot do then?
It'll automatically put in a brulee, and it'll accept the trade any time the other user has put an overpay on their site.
This tradebot uses the trading-values of https://jbvalues.com/, and automatically updates the values every 10 minutes (20 minutes faster than before!!)

NOTE: Inventories with MORE value / MORE items, will gain MORE value when running the tradebot.
